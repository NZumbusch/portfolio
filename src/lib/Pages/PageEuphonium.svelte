            I started playing the Euphonium when I was about 5 years old. I was instantly hooked. 
            Fast forward a few years and I have successfully taken part in multiple competitions, solo as well as part of an orchestra.
            I really enjoy playing the Euphonium not only because of its superb sound, but also because of its speed and the freedom it gives the player.
